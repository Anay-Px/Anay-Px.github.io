    <p>In our program, we use numerous pictures that we have set to become turtles, as the nest, and the chicken. The chicken asks the user how many eggs to lay, and what color each egg should be, and lays them into the nest below it. The color of the eggs are stored in a list variable. The eggs randomly have a chance of staying as eggs, turning into omelets, or becoming chicks. It goes as follows: 50% chance of staying as an egg, 25% chance of becoming an omelete, and another 25% chance of being born as a chick.

    <h2>Indiana Banana</h2>

      <p>This program uses the turtle module to create a platforming game, that revolves around a minion who is trying to obtain the sacred golden Banana from an ancient dungeon. The minion needs to dodge spikes, rolling boulders, and other obstacles to get to the end of the course. Information of each level is stored in a list variable, and the minion avatar is a turtle that changes its state when moving, and teleports back to the start of the screen when it comes in contact with an enemy or obstacle.</p>
