    <p>In our program, we use numerous pictures that we have set to become turtles, as the nest, and the chicken. The chicken asks how many eggs to lay, and what color each of them should be, and lays them into the nest below it. The eggs randomly have a chance of staying as eggs, turning into omelets, or becoming chicks.
